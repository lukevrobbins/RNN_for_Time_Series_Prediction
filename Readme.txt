This project consists of building a Reccurent Neural Network from scratch and testing the application on time-series data, using Python and minimal Python libraries. 
We chose to use stock price data over more than 20 years to predict the next day's close price, showing that the model performance left much to be desired. 

Methods and conclusions can be found in the word document titled "report.docx" (IEEE Format) and all applicable code is written in Group_Project.ipynb
